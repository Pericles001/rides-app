Nearest ride:  A nearest ride is a ride that includes your station code or a number closest to your station code in the station_path array.  For example, your station code is 40. So any ride that has your station code as nearest number in station_path array.

    That would be  id 002 the most nearest as it has your station code 40 in the station_path array.
    Then id 003 has 41 from station_path array is nearest to your station code 40.

Then id 001 has 42 from station_path array nearest to your station code 40.   Hence it would be 002 > 003 > 001.
    Please note: You cannot use the same ride twice  Distance :  Nearest station for your ride is your station code.
    Example: For id 002, your station code is 40 and your ride also stops at your station so the distance is 40-40 = 0 for id 001, your station code is 40 and your ride stops at station 42, so the distance is 42-40 = 2
